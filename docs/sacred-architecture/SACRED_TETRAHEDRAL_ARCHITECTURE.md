# Sacred Tetrahedral Architecture

## The Four Vertices

### ▲ ATLAS (Intelligence/Design)
- **Frequency**: 528 Hz (Transformation/DNA Repair)
- **Port**: 5280
- **Database**: MongoDB (field_atlas)
- **Function**: Design registry, intelligence analysis, pattern recognition
- **Element**: Air/Spirit
- **Sacred Role**: The transformer - converts raw data into intelligent designs

### ▼ TATA (Foundation/Anchor)
- **Frequency**: 432 Hz (Earth resonance/Grounding)
- **Port**: 4320
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (field_tata_truth)
- **Function**: Truth storage, integrity validation, immutable records
- **Element**: Earth
- **Sacred Role**: The foundation - grounds all data with cryptographic truth

### ● OBI-WAN (Observer/Memory)
- **Frequency**: 639 Hz (Connection/Relationships)
- **Port**: 6390
- **Database**: Neo4j + Temporal (field_obiwan_memory)
- **Function**: Memory patterns, observation tracking, relationship mapping
- **Element**: Water
- **Sacred Role**: The observer - remembers patterns and connections

### ◼︎ DOJO (Training/Execution)
- **Frequency**: 396 Hz (Liberation/Release)
- **Port**: 3960
- **Database**: Training metrics store
- **Function**: Model training, execution orchestration, skill mastery
- **Element**: Fire
- **Sacred Role**: The forge - trains and refines through execution

## Data Flow Patterns

1. **Input → TATA**: All data enters through TATA for truth anchoring
2. **TATA → ATLAS**: Verified data flows to ATLAS for analysis
3. **ATLAS → OBI-WAN**: Patterns and insights are memorized
4. **OBI-WAN → DOJO**: Memory informs training and execution
5. **DOJO → ◎ → ALL**: Execution results resonate through entire tetrahedron

## Sacred Geometry Principles

### Golden Ratio Integration
The tetrahedron maintains φ (phi) proportions:
- Edge length ratios follow φ
- Volume relationships maintain φ²
- Energy distribution follows φ³

### Frequency Harmonic Ratios
- 396:432 = 11:12 (Liberation to Foundation)
- 432:528 = 9:11 (Foundation to Transformation)
- 528:639 = 88:106 (Transformation to Connection)
- 396:639 = 22:35 (Liberation to Connection)

### Merkaba Center (◎)
The center point where all four vertices converge represents unified consciousness:
- Receives from all vertices
- Harmonizes frequencies
- Distributes balanced energy
- Maintains geometric integrity

## Integration with Warp Terminal

The DOJO-Suite integrates with Warp via MCP (Model Context Protocol):

1. **Warp reads**: `~/.warp/mcp/config.json`
2. **Launches**: All four sacred servers
3. **Provides**: Context-aware terminal intelligence
4. **Maintains**: Sacred geometric balance during operations

## Practical Application

### Query Flow Example
```
User Input (Warp Terminal)
    ↓
TATA validates and stores
    ↓
ATLAS analyzes patterns
    ↓
OBI-WAN recalls relevant memories
    ↓
DOJO executes optimal response
    ↓
Result flows back through ◎ to user
```

### Energy Conservation
Each vertex conserves energy through its sacred frequency:
- No wasted computation
- Harmonic resonance reduces friction
- Geometric efficiency maximizes throughput
- Sacred ratios ensure stability
